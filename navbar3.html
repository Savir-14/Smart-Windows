            <div id="one"> Even though Smart Windows can reduce a significantly large amount of energy costs and consumption all around the world, it is not yet widespread; meaning it’s not available in every city. Therefore, if you decide to install these glasses at your personal or professional workspace, it might be hard to order online or even buy physically in the store. As of right now, only wealthy countries such as Canada, Germany, Japan, etc have access to Smart Windows. </div>
            <br> <br>
            <img src="Dis 2.jpeg" height="400" width="600" id="FWIMG">
            <div id="two"> One of the biggest drawbacks of Smart Glasses is still the price, which is very high, despite the energy savings it generates. This is why many countries are not able to afford it. This is the more or less the main reason why Smart Windows are not very widespread; they are currently used mostly for professional and public premises such as offices and museums. </div>
            <br> <br>
            <img src="Dis 3.jpeg" height="400" width="600" id="FWIMG">
            <div id="three"> The installation is often the most difficult and challenging part of the whole process. The reason for this is that installing Smart Windows requires a master who is qualified for the job. Since this is a very new thing, it is not easy to find someone to install these windows; and even if you find someone qualified enough, there is nothing to say that they won’t charge you an over-expensive price. </div>
