        <div id="TOSW_box">
            <h4 style="text-align: center;"> Electrochromic </h4>
            <p> Electrochromic Glass is an electronically tintable glass that is used for windows, skylights, facades, and curtain walls. This type of glass is very popular for its ability to improve the user’s comfort, maximize access to daylight and outdoor views, and reduce energy costs. Electrochromic Glass is a smart solution for buildings where solar control is a challenge; healthcare facilities, retail spaces, museums, etc. This specific type of glass has been linked to faster rates of learning and patient recovery, improvisation in emotional wellness, and has even increased the productivity of employees. This Smart Glass offers a huge variety of control options. For example, users can operate automatic control settings to manage light, glare, energy, and use color rendering. For people who desire more control, you can also manually alter the tint of the glass using a wall panel. </p>

        <div id="TOSW_box">
            <h4 style="text-align: center;"> Photochromic </h4>
            <p> Photochromic Windows are very similar to Electrochromic Glass. The transference of light through the photochromic glass is affected by an outside source, only this time it’s UV radiation. Usually, it can be affected by any light of sufficient intensity. However, unlike electrochromic glass, in this glass, the transparency changes when the applied light source changes. This technology is most commonly seen in optical lenses that block sun when outdoors but remain clean otherwise. </p>

        <div id="TOSW_box">
            <h4 style="text-align: center;"> Thermochromic </h4>
            <p> Thermochromic Windows are a type of Smart Window whose transition depends on the temperature outside. Technology in these windows allow them to change their color to block glare and reduce unwanted solar heating when the glass gets warm on a hot day. This can block light, heat, and glare while still maintaing a clear view of the city outside. Not only can this Smart Window make buildings use less power, but it can also generate it, increasing their contribution to the broader energy grid’s needs. </p>

        <div id="TOSW_box">
            <h4 style="text-align: center;"> Suspended Particle </h4>
            <p> This is a very special type of Smart Glass because it is used everywhere. For opacity, the nanoparticles in this window are randomly organized to block and absorb light. When electricity is applied, the suspended particles align to allow light to pass through. The amount of light allowed to pass depends on the variance of voltage, making it fully controlled by the user. With Suspended Particle Smart Glasses, the voltage can be controlled through photosensors, motion detectors, apps, and computer systems. </p>

        <div id="TOSW_box">
            <h4 style="text-align: center;"> Micro Blind </h4>
            <p> Micro Blind Smart Glasses are thin, rolled metal blinds positioned on windows that can be controlled with electricity. This type of smart glass provides a higher level of privacy and can be adjusted like regular blinds to control light and privacy settings. When there is no  voltage of electricity applied to these blinds, they are rolled up and light can pass through. When electricity is applied, an electric field forms between the glass and the blinds that makes the blinds unroll and flatten out to block the light from entering. </p>

        <div id="TOSW_box">
            <h4 style="text-align: center;"> Polymer Dispersed Liquid Crystals </h4>
            <p> Polymer Dispersed Liquid Crystals, or dissolved liquid crystals on the polymer or glass in this technology harden and form droplets throughout the polymer or glass sheet. The job of these droplets is to scatter light and make the glass appear milky. When electricity is applied to this glass, the liquid crystals align and allow the light to pass through, almost similar to suspended-particle glass. This type of smart glass is typically used in bathrooms, conference rooms, and hospitals as it offers a ton of privacy controls. </p>
