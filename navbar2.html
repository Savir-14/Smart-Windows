            <p> We need Smart Windows because they are the only type of technology that can block light and protect us from harmful UV <br> rays and radiation. Most Smart Glass Windows can block ultraviolet (UV) rays from entering the building. Now, you might <br> be thinking who cares about UV light, it’s just a window. UV lights can harm the skin and damage DNA if you come in too <br> much contact with it. It can also give you a suntan or sunburn, along with an increased risk of skin cancer. <br> <br> Smart Windows have many benefits to them, but the ones that I am going to talk about are: </p>

            <p style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px; text-align: center;"> Smart Glass Windows reduce the amount of direct sunlight entering your work or personal space. It reflects the heat away from your windows meaning your air conditioner has to work less to keep a comfortable temperature for you. When your air conditioner works less, the cost of your electricity bills will go down. These savings will vary based on different factors but a lot of money can eventually be saved and spent on a better cost if your air conditioner isn’t turned on the whole day. </p>

        <div class="row"> 
            <h4 style="text-align: center;"> Maintained Temperature </h4>
            <p style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px; text-align: center;"> If you think about it, your AC works so hard to keep a maintained and comfortable temperature for you on hot and sunny days. When sunlight enters your windows and warms up the interior of your houses or buildings, you need to turn on the AC. With normal windows, cold air leaks out of your room so you don’t get the best the air conditioner has to offer. Smart Glass Windows are a solution for this because they block the heat that tries to enter your room. While using these windows, you also receive an extra layer of protection against radiation and strength to the windows. </p>

        <div class="row"> 
            <h4 style="text-align: center;"> Improved Security / Privacy  </h4>
            <p style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px; text-align: center;"> Switchable Smart Windows help a lot in improving security at your home or office in multiple ways. The most obvious way is by making the tint of your glass lower or higher so that it becomes more difficult to look inside your cubicles or personal spaces. If you add films to your windows, you will also receive a second security benefit because the glass will become harder to break. Even if the glass breaks, there will be smaller fragments of broken glass because the film will still hold most of the pieces together. Smart Windows work by sending a tiny electrical current between the panels, which switches the glass from clear to non-transparent in less than a hundredth of a second. Even though these windows are used across a range of sectors, from hotels to banks, they are most useful in office spaces where privacy is often most required. </p>

        <div class="row"> 
            <h4 style="text-align: center;"> Increased Productivity </h4>
            <p style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px; text-align: center;"> Smart Windows helps businesses and workspaces the most because it offers a potential increase in employee productivity. The reason for this is that Smart Windows can allow light to pass through without too much excessive heat or glare. Natural light has also been proven to promote better workflow and productivity. These windows, which reduce light and glare, make it easier to see the computer screens without too much eye strain. </p>
